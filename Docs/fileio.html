<strong>Saving:</strong><br>

 <br><br>
 If you wish to save another copy of the<br>

<strong>Loading:</strong><br>
Puzzles can be loaded from properly formatted<br>
text files. A file is properly formatted if the<br>
first 9 lines of the file are numbers separated<br>
by spaces. For readibility, 0s may be represented<br>
as "_".<br><br>
A properly formatted line:<br>
3 _ _ 2 _ 5 6 1 4<br><br>

<br>
Cafe Sudoku will inform you if the file is not<br>
properly formatted. If the file is formatted correctly,<br>
it will automatically make it the current puzzle<br>
being worked on.<br>

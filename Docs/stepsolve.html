Cafe Sudoku

<strong>Step Solving</strong><br>
Cafe Sudoku employs a method of display how it works<br>
called "Step Solve."<br>
<br>
Step solve works by showing you exactly what Cafe<br>
Sudoku is doing to solve the puzzle. It shows you<br>
what puzzle cell is being examined, and also shows<br>
how that cell is being changed.<br><br>
While in the middle of solve step, you have the<br>
options of taking the next step towards solving,<br>
letting Cafe Sudoku solve the rest of the puzzle,<br>
or stopping, and solving the rest yourself.<br>

This is a Sudoku program written in Java employing Swing. It is starting as my Final Project for CS338:GUI at Drexel University. A rough demo will be ready by the end of March 2007.

Capabilities will include solving user inputted puzzles, exporting solved and partially solved puzzles to file, and possibly generating puzzles.

The algorithm for solving will be a cleaned up and extended version of old code I wrote a few years back, currently located at www.pages.drexel.edu/~mjg722/sudoku
